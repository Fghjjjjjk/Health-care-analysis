# Health-care-analysis
 This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques applied to a dataset containing patient information. The dataset includes features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and other health metrics. Initially, data preprocessing steps were performed, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Feature engineering techniques were then applied to enhance the dataset, creating new features that potentially improve the predictive accuracy of the models. A decision tree classifier was chosen and trained on the engineered dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The model achieved promising results with an accuracy of approximately 86.36%, indicating its effectiveness in healthcare analytics. Further steps involved validating the model on a test dataset, optimizing its performance through parameter tuning and additional feature engineering, and visualizing the decision tree structure to interpret key predictors. This project not only aims to provide accurate predictions but also explores insights into factors influencing diabetes diagnosis, potentially aiding in early detection and personalized healthcare strategies.
