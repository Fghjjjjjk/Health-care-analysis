# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques applied to a dataset containing patient information. The dataset includes features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and other health metrics.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- Performing feature engineering to create new features that potentially enhance model performance.
- Building a decision tree classifier to predict diabetes based on patient data.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualizing the decision tree structure to interpret key predictors influencing diabetes prediction.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks or R Markdown files detailing data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
- **scripts/**: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Saved model files (e.g., .rds files for R) after training.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project, instructions for setup, usage, and interpretation of results.
